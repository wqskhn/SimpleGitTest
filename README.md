# SimpleGitTest
This is a sample git learning tutorial that i set up for myself.

Basic Concept:
  Git is simply keeping track of any changes to the file (files,directory/ies). How it's doing this? Git has three states, namely MODIFY, STAGE, COMMIT
  
  MODIFY: display any modifcation in the location where git is inited and display to user.
  STAGE: User add the desire file to stage (temperory place) for review 
  COMMIT: After review file is committed to git for future references.
  
  Git Commands to perform  the above functionalities
  
  init
  add
  rm
  mv
  diff
  diff --cached
  commit -m
